# Pixacular
 
Heya Reading this I hope you are fine and I'm glad you are here, let me tell you , you are AWESOME. 
At first i would like to tell you why i named it "PIXACULAR", so pixacular is inspired with the idea of how exactly this thing works + what was my reaction on watching "How this thing worked."
 
So the idea is COLORIZING the old or black and white PICS by using Artificial Intelligence Modules ain't it SPECTACULAR.

(o: Apologies for being on height of logiclessness LOL :o )
